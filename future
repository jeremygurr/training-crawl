basic senses
  vision
    drawing level view 
      consider if square is visible right now
      if not, is it in memory?
    haze: can see twice as far for vague shapes, but not identify until in actual visual range
  how to view different senses?
    view command switches view
      vision
      hearing
      smell
      feel
      energy
    dimensions
  hearing
    grid of arrows with brightness, pointing the flow of sound
    player can 'hear' the grid around them based on their hearing sensitivity
      (3x3 grid is poor, 4x4 is avg, 5x5+ is good)
    there can be multiple overlapping sounds
      can only detect the top 2-4 depending on sense
    enhanced by meditation state
    can focus on one sound at a time
  smell
    can only smell a small grid around the player 1x1 - 3x3
  feel: 
    can only feel squares immediately around the player
    heat
    vibration / pressure
  energy
  if one sense is lost, others should be magnified
energy in environment
  cells store energy
  energy moves between cells
    conductance different for different materials
      typically slow (1-3)
    capacity different for different materials
      typically fairly large (1000)
external channels
  all pools can vent except interna
  OO=SG OO=ED
movement
  fast / loud
  normal (lowest stamina usage)
  slow / quiet
weapon usage
  weapon prioritization
  chance to hit
    check against dodge, deflect, block
    force
      skill
      weapon
      dex
      speed
      enemy size
    resist
      distance
      enemy dodge/deflect/block skill
      enemy dex
      enemy movement
  damage
    force
      skill
      weapon
      str (depending on weapon)
    resist
      enemy armor
ranged attacks
export / import game
armor
different times for actions
game clock
  enemy actions don't execute until they have received enough time
receiving major / critical damage will have different effects
  minor damage has no effect
  major damage
    causes random damage to other interna: mana, stamina, and willpower
  critical damage gives a chance of a bad status: (in addition to major damage effect)
    confused (occasional misdirected attack / movement)
    stunned (occasional missed turn)
    slowed (all movement is 25% slower)
    dulled (senses are reduced in effectiveness)
    these statuses are removed as healing energy enters this interna, which is absorbed by the
      status before increasing the actual pool

multi-floor
  stairs
  10 floors for now
  floor difficulty level concept
    somewhat random, with 1, 50, and 100 floors being fixed. 50 will be set to difficulty level
how to vary item generation?
  item energy, gets used by each item generated
  if not enough energy, then item isn't generated
  each item has a generation cost
  top floor starts with 100 points of each generation color
  each floor has a core, which adds points to that generation color * the level of the floor
core attributes
cell attributes
  5 levels of depth
  smells (5 levels)
  energy (each energy pool)
  temperature
farming
  hoe
    can be used to plant something into the ground
  shovel
    can be used to dig something up to put into inventory
  seeds are placed on ground and grow if the required energy is available
  base foods can be eaten or seeds extracted from
  farming skills determine how many seeds you can extract
  some monsters can breed
    if sufficient food energy is available
    most monsters feed off of one kind of energy and produce another
mining / fishing / foraging
  can find gem stones and gold
  should be fairly difficult
  but not tedious
    mine / fish / forage large regions of the map at once
      based on skill, from 2x2 -> whole level
  need to use skills to find evidence of minerals
  differences
    mining can only be done once, but returns more valuable objects (gems and money)
      requires pickaxe
        can create shallow and deep pits, and can break rocks
    fishing can be done repeatedly, depending on the energy that exists in pools of water
      requires fishing pole
      colored fish provide the color + blue
      harvesting early gives you supplies more quickly, but less
    harvesting/foraging is more complex, since it yields ingredients that can be combined to provide more powerful foods or potions
      does not require an item, although an item is needed to plant things that weren't already there
      can be done repeatedly
      depends on what's growing in the area
      harvesting early gives you supplies more quickly, but less
quick travel
  auto-explore
  auto-attack
  instant move 
    to a place on an empty floor

  auto-travel
    works even if monsters are around
    attitudes:
      avoid monsters
      ignore all items
willpower is gained from successful activities
  killing a monster
  discovering valuable items
  achievements
  successful spell casting
  successful weapon strike
  successful dodge or deflect or block
  scroll of motivation
  most food gives a small amount of willpower
    dessert food gives larger amount: chocolate, cake, etc
  stealth success
willpower is drained by 
  being hit
  pain
  spells failing
  fear
  stealth detection
low interna
  starvation constantly attempts to deplete HP, MP, SP (not WP)
    red, orange, yellow energy is consumed to counter this, unless there is no energy available, in which case hp is lost
    there is an idle rate that these deplete, although it is slow
    HP = 0 : dead
    SP = 0 : occasional fainting
    MP = 0 : occasional confusion
instadeath avoidance
  the player must receive damage after all health < 1 at beginning of turn before death occurs

monster corpses and spirits
  their intent and skills are part of the spirit
  spirit dissipates slowly
  body decays slowly
if player dies, spirit is still alive for a time
  player has mp and wp, but not hp or sp
  can cast spells, but not hold items
  once wp is gone, spirit falls apart
  can't eat or drink potions or read scrolls
  can possess another body if powerful enough
  or resurrect original body
  invisible to most monsters, although other spirits can see 
  can still be attacked with magic
  physical attacks don't work
  does changing species change spirit?
    yes, changes are retained

  potions !: doesn't require energy or intelligence. Alters the user, or can affect weapons. Takes a medium amount of time
  scrolls @: can cast any spell without energy as long as there's enough intelligence. But it takes more time than most actions
  wands /: convert mp into a single spell, without needing intelligence. Takes very little time. No charges
  rings =:
    attribute: boost that attribute
    pool: increase size of that pool
  amulets -: much more powerful than rings, but only one can be worn, and it takes more time to take effect
    polymorph: changes character to the given creature while worn

    pearl: white
    ruby: red
gems and runes (stones) can be merged into weapons
  sockets aren't used
  each insertion reduces durability (1/3)
shops
  fixed shops
  monsters can't enter
  player can't attack when inside of a shop
  can they heal, read scrolls, etc?
  dropping item onto floor sells it
  picking item up buys it
  They can buy and sell, but price is based on demand
    price of every item is based on how many are held by shops throughout the dungeon
    the more of a given type of item, the cheaper it is
    if you sell an item, that item's price becomes lower, since there is more supply. But calculated price is what the value is after it was sold, making re-buy price = sell price
    sell price != buy price for a single item at one time
  merchants occupy real level space: 
    1/2   3x3
    1/4   4x4
    1/8   5x5
    1/16  6x6
    1/32  7x7
    1/64  8x8
    1/64  9x9
    <5x5 is usually a speciality store
    >=5x5 is usually a general store (although there's a small chance of the opposite)
  buy, then reselling must always be the same price
  total price is product of several factors
    rarity based: (rarity_factor = (1 + count of that type) / total_items_spawned)
      item class: potion, weapon, armor, scroll...
      item type: spear, axe, dagger...
      item enhancement level: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4...
      item brand: fire, ice, none
    scale based: (rarity_factor = 1/(1+level))
      item level
      item charge
      socket count
    inverting the product of the rarity_factors gives the actual price of the product
  every 3 floors should have a store
  every 3 stores should be a mega-store
    either a large store (6+)
    or a bazaar (3+ normal stores)
  items are sorted by rarity
  shops half full
  generated item count is fixed when level is generated, and is multiplied by store stability factor (10?)
trees
  wet
  normal
  dry
    can catch on fire, and dry out or light other trees nearby

dungeon is a stack of 100 floors, but there are some branches and planes
branches
  5 floors which lead to a boss floor and a rune
  20 runes total (one for each energy pool)
  each branch is of a single energy pool color
    branches will tend to be found on a floor of the same color, but if there are no floors of that color, a random one will be chosen
  difficulty level of the branch is the difficulty level of the floor on which the branch entrance is found + level of branch
dimensions
  5 z positions for each cell?
  w dimension to get to ketheric, etheric, astral, dungeon, abyss, void, pandemonium, oblivion
  can set dimensions, 2 or 3 on main view
planes
  lower planes have less energy
  bringing creatures to higher planes makes them have a better attitute towards the player (easier to command)

  spirit master
    can't carry equipment unless possessing another creature
    can move from one creature to another

    [ ] exploring a floor
    [ ] killing monsters
    [ ] getting deeper in the dungeon
    [*] experience potions (one per floor)
  one level up per experience potion

  each player that dies is saved with all of their equipment and stats
  tombstones are randomly generated on floors, with info about the player who died,
    and what items are left behind
  if player digs at tombstone they will get an item left behind by that dead player,
    but there is a 1/3 chance of waking the dead, and they will have to fight a spirit
    with reduced specs of the original player

info
energy management
  hunger / display hunger
  where does it come from?
    dungeon core generates energy for the dungeon
      always one color
      player auto-absorbs if pressure is in the right direction
  connection flow
    max amount of lower energy to move in an aut
    levels:
      9 = 100%
      8 = 50%
      7 = 25%
      6 = 12%
      5 = 6%
      4 = 3%
      3 = 1.5%
      2 = 0.75%
      1 = 0.37%
      0 = 0.1%
  overdriving energy capacity
    causes damage to the energy pool
      pain and reduction of max capacity of pools involved
      energy leaks from the pool if there is damage, proportional to the damage level
      how to repair damaged pools
        higher tier pools that are connected will first repair the damage before filling the pool
        repair cost is one higher tier point per damage point
      damage per aut = ([overloaded amount] / [max]) ^ 4 / 10
  tiers 0-4
    1 tier 4 = 10 tier 3 = 100 tier 2 = 1000 tier 1 = 10000 tier 0
