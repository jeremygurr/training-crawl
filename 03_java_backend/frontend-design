Frontend Design of Crawl:

Lobby/login page components:
	-> cookie checker. If user cookie exist, auto-login.
	-> Header
	  -> left-side header: Welcome to Crawl! + icon
	  -> Right-side header default: login username+password | register
	  	-> After login right-side header becomes: Change email | change password | logout
			-> When click change email opens modal with email, username and new email inputs.
			-> When click change password it opens modal with username password and new password inputs.
			-> When click logout erases cookies and goes back to default right-side header.
	-> Table with filter buttons which contains all current users and their scores and level of dungeon etc...
