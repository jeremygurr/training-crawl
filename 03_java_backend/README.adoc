== Quick Run
NOTE: If you haven't gone through Development Environment Setup steps already, these steps won't work. Go follow those steps first.

All these commands work best when you are in the /training-crawl/03_java_backend/ directory.

Pull teammates latest commits:
```
git pull teammateName main
```

Start MySQL:
```
./start_mysql
```

Run all Unit and integration tests:
```
./gradlew clean test
```

Run app and view inside browser:
```
./gradlew clean run
In your browser go to: http://localhost:8080/static/login.html
```

Stop MySQL container:
```
docker stop mysql
```

== Development Environment Setup

Before you start development each day, you'll always want to do git pull from the various remotes of other teammates to make sure
you don't develop a branch separate from everyone else making things in different directions. In order for git pull to work, you need to add each
teammates remote repos:
```
git remote add jared https://github.com/jgurr4/training-crawl.git
git remote add jeremy https://github.com/jeremygurr/training-crawl.git
etc...
```

List all remotes you currently have:
```
git remote -v
```

Pull from teammates remotes:
```
git pull teammateName main
```

Next you will want to make sure all tests run correctly before you begin developing so that you know which tests work. However,
some of these tests rely on a mysql container to already be running and have specific tables
and databases setup in the correct structure for the tests to work. So always startup mysql container before you run the tests.
Follow these steps below to get the environment for mysql setup correctly:

For first-time setup only: Set up start_mysql variables in ~/.bashrc or bash profile.
```
export training_crawl_data=/path/to/crawl-training-extra/mysqldata   ##make the crawl-training-extra directory anywhere you want. Don't make the mysqldata folder, it creates itself.
export training_crawl_repo=/path/to/training-crawl/03_java_backend
```
NOTE: Close bash tab and open a new tab in order for the new tab to be using these new variables you added.

Start MySQL:
```
./start_mysql
```

For first-time setup only: Configure MySQL with correct database and tables structure:
```
docker exec -it mysql /bin/bash
mysql -u root -p                   ##password is whatever you set inside start_mysql, default is 'password'.
source mysqlScripts/updates/0.0.0
source mysqlScripts/sampleData.sql
CTRL+D exits the cli and the container.
```

Now you can run the tests without a problem since mysql is setup correctly:
```
./gradlew test
```

Finally, after following all these steps you can begin to develop using the app.

One last piece of advice:
Always run the unit and integration tests once more before you make a commit of any kind. This ensures
that the things you changed didn't affect or break the tests in any way. If no test was broken, then you can
go ahead and make your commit. However, if you notice a test is failing that was not failing before, then you
should spend time re-evaluating your code and see where you might have caused it to break.

== Building

To launch your tests:
```
./gradlew clean test
```

To package your application:
```
./gradlew clean assemble
```

To run your application:
```
./gradlew clean run
```


== Mysql Version Change Fix
In rare occasions we may change the mariadb version. If we do this, we'll make it known in the git commit message.
If you see that message use the following commands to update your container.

To fix container if a MariaDB/MySQL version change occurs:
```
cd ~/crawl-training-extra/
sudo rm -rf mysqldata
```
After that, you need to restart mysql container, using the updated start_mysql script and source the
setup database and tables scripts inside mysql again.
