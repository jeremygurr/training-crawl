creatures / players have same energy pool flow, heat, smell and sound generation
  line up model
    split spirits from creatures
  make actions handle it
should creatures starve to death too?
  maybe fed by the dungeon?
baseline dungeon temp
baseline rat temp
player produces heat
player reacts to heat
make smell drop off whenever below threshold
make creatures and players have the same energy flow / heat / sense 
basic senses
  feel 
    can only feel squares immediately around the player
    heat
      moves like energy
    vibration / pressure
  energy
    not lost like smell
      unless absorbed into an energy sink
    for each cell
      choose a single random adjacent cell
      do normal pressure based energy transfer
  how to view different senses?
    view command switches view
      vision
      hearing
      smell
      feel
      energy
    dimensions
  if one sense is lost, others should be magnified
  negative impact
  can reduce senses (like channels)
  senses are species specific, and can't easily be enhanced
generate different quantities of items
energy in environment
  cells store energy
  energy moves between cells
    conductance different for different materials
      typically slow (1-3)
    capacity different for different materials
      typically fairly large (1000)
make target not reveal things not yet seen
external channels
  all pools can vent except interna
  OO=SG OO=ED
difference between body and spirit
  body
    interna
    spectra
  spirit
    etherea
    lumina
    exotica
      used to help spirit act
    limits
      can't drink potions or carry things or equip items
      can eat an item on the floor, although unless it gives an energy that the spirit can hold, it does no good
      can draw energy from gems
      will be seen by other spirit creatures, and can be destroyed
      naturally leaks all energy pools at 100x normal leak speed
      can see and feel, but not smell or hear
different times for actions
game clock
  enemy actions don't execute until they have received enough time
movement
  fast / loud
  normal (lowest stamina usage)
  slow / quiet
ranged count item generation

    resist
      enemy armor
ranged attacks
export / import game
armor
receiving major / critical damage will have different effects
  minor damage has no effect
  major damage
    causes random damage to other interna: mana, stamina, and willpower
  critical damage gives a chance of a bad status: (in addition to major damage effect)
    confused (occasional misdirected attack / movement)
    stunned (occasional missed turn)
    slowed (all movement is 25% slower)
    dulled (senses are reduced in effectiveness)
    these statuses are removed as healing energy enters this interna, which is absorbed by the
      status before increasing the actual pool
examine pools
  use scratch space
  data model 
  out and in commands
  draw target based on what's being focussed
  define visual blocks
  add details to visual blocks
  show details associated with selected object
auto-help
  based on input mode
  should describe windows also
auto-save after 10 turns
ask if we should load game when starting
multi-floor
  stairs
  10 floors for now
  floor difficulty level concept
    somewhat random, with 1, 50, and 100 floors being fixed. 50 will be set to difficulty level
how to vary item generation?
  item energy, gets used by each item generated
  if not enough energy, then item isn't generated
  each item has a generation cost
  top floor starts with 100 points of each generation color
  each floor has a core, which adds points to that generation color * the level of the floor
core attributes
  str
  dex
  int
  charisma 
    good for a summoner
  constitution
    does not boost health, but does improve disease and poison resistance

    attitudes:
      avoid monsters
      ignore all items
willpower is gained from successful activities
  killing a monster
  discovering valuable items
  achievements
  successful spell casting
  successful weapon strike
  successful dodge or deflect or block
  scroll of motivation
  most food gives a small amount of willpower
    dessert food gives larger amount: chocolate, cake, etc
  stealth success
willpower is drained by 
  being hit
  pain
  spells failing
  fear
  stealth detection
low interna
  starvation constantly attempts to deplete HP, MP, SP (not WP)
    red, orange, yellow energy is consumed to counter this, unless there is no energy available, in which case hp is lost
    there is an idle rate that these deplete, although it is slow
    HP = 0 : dead
    SP = 0 : occasional fainting
    MP = 0 : occasional confusion
instadeath avoidance
  the player must receive damage after all health < 1 at beginning of turn before death occurs

  persuasion
everything destructable
monster corpses and spirits
  their intent and skills are part of the spirit
  spirit dissipates slowly
  body decays slowly
if player dies, spirit is still alive for a time
  player has mp and wp, but not hp or sp
  can cast spells, but not hold items
  once wp is gone, spirit falls apart
  can't eat or drink potions or read scrolls
  can possess another body if powerful enough
  or resurrect original body
  invisible to most monsters, although other spirits can see 
  can still be attacked with magic
  physical attacks don't work
  does changing species change spirit?
    yes, changes are retained
  all energy pools leak slowly as a spirit
  can pass through walls as spirit

  armor ]
  ammo (
  shield )
  potions !: doesn't require energy or intelligence. Alters the user, or can affect weapons. Takes a medium amount of time
  scrolls @: can cast any spell without energy as long as there's enough intelligence. But it takes more time than most actions
  wands /: convert mp into a single spell, without needing intelligence. Takes very little time. No charges
  rings =:
    attribute: boost that attribute
    pool: increase size of that pool
  amulets -: much more powerful than rings, but only one can be worn, and it takes more time to take effect
    polymorph: changes character to the given creature while worn
    protection

    pearl: white
    ruby: red
gems and runes (stones) can be merged into weapons
  sockets aren't used
  each insertion reduces durability (1/3)
shops
  fixed shops
  monsters can't enter
  player can't attack when inside of a shop
  can they heal, read scrolls, etc?
  dropping item onto floor sells it
  picking item up buys it
  They can buy and sell, but price is based on demand
    price of every item is based on how many are held by shops throughout the dungeon
    the more of a given type of item, the cheaper it is
    if you sell an item, that item's price becomes lower, since there is more supply. But calculated price is what the value is after it was sold, making re-buy price = sell price
    sell price != buy price for a single item at one time
  merchants occupy real level space: 
    1/2   3x3
    1/4   4x4
    1/8   5x5
    1/16  6x6
    1/32  7x7
    1/64  8x8
    1/64  9x9
    <5x5 is usually a speciality store
    >=5x5 is usually a general store (although there's a small chance of the opposite)
  buy, then reselling must always be the same price
  total price is product of several factors
    rarity based: (rarity_factor = (1 + count of that type) / total_items_spawned)
      item class: potion, weapon, armor, scroll...
      item type: spear, axe, dagger...
      item enhancement level: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4...
      item brand: fire, ice, none
    scale based: (rarity_factor = 1/(1+level))
      item level
      item charge
      socket count
    inverting the product of the rarity_factors gives the actual price of the product
  every 3 floors should have a store
  every 3 stores should be a mega-store
    either a large store (6+)
    or a bazaar (3+ normal stores)
  items are sorted by rarity
  shops half full
  generated item count is fixed when level is generated, and is multiplied by store stability factor (10?)
trees
  wet
  normal
  dry
    can catch on fire, and dry out or light other trees nearby
consume item
dungeon is a stack of 100 floors, but there are some branches and planes
branches
  5 floors which lead to a boss floor and a rune
  20 runes total (one for each energy pool)
  each branch is of a single energy pool color
    branches will tend to be found on a floor of the same color, but if there are no floors of that color, a random one will be chosen
  difficulty level of the branch is the difficulty level of the floor on which the branch entrance is found, with each level of the branch increasing difficulty by 20%
dimensions
  5 z positions for each cell?
  w dimension to get to ketheric, etheric, astral, dungeon, abyss, void, pandemonium, oblivion

  growth master
    allows adjusting growth points
    faster growth rate, depending on level of discipline gained
  travel master
    provides teleportation abilities, even across dimensions
  time master
    cheap power: foresight
      can test a future, which automatically rewinds after time limit expires
    strong power: checkpoint rewind (must happen before death)
    time bubble: time slows down outside of bubble, but inside normal flow
    super strong power: second chance (must be cast before dying), will rewind a short time before death should death occur
  spirit master
    can't carry equipment unless possessing another creature
    can move from one creature to another
    must store up enough energy before dying to be able to possess another 
    leaving before dying is better, since death causes a backlash greatly reducing the spirits power

challenge / defense calculation
  diff = challenge - defense 
  power = 2^(diff/4)
  chance = power/(power+1)
damage calculation
  (damage_range * random + base_damage) * chance * 2
  max_damage = (damage_range + base_damage) * 2
  min_damage = 0
defenses
  dodge

alchemy
  each ingredient has multiple effects
  only dominant 2 effects will happen, lower ones will be ignored
  combining ingredients can cancel out dominant effects to allow weaker effect to come out
  amplification process works by combining the same ingredients
  gathering ingredients:
    not dropped from monsters
    automatically picked up as you discover new empty floor spaces
    higher chance of finding quality ingredients based on alchemy skill

crafting
  describe what can be crafted from given materials
    two groups: 
      directly craftable
      indirectly craftable
  materials are gathered in the same way as alchemy ingredients
  higher chance of finding quality ingredients based on crafting skill

magic foundation
  templates maintain physical existence
  physical properties randomly decay, and templates resist that (but then decay themselves)
  can create templates to stabilize templates, as many levels as needed
  a template won't change anything unless there is the right kind of energy available

bodies
  spirit is foundation, and fundamentally different than other bodies
    can only store 5 points of each energy type (making energy refinement impossible)
    energy generation is the same
    can't eat
    but can quickly absorb energy from surroundings
    can use spells
    can't use weapons or armor
    not damaged by physical attacks
    can pass through walls
    much more sensitive to energy
    can influence corporeal bodies
    moves by spreading out spirit and gathering it back up
      one space is designated as spirit core, and spirit will either gather to or spread away from it
      distance is controllable also
        0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 15
      spread may be radial or directional
        360 degrees, 180, 90, 45, 22, 11, 5, 2, 1 (depending on focus ability)
      concentration ratio
        two modes: spread / gather
        spread
          9:1
          6:1
          4:1 more concentrated around root, less spread
          3:1 
          2:1 means spirit will only transfer from A to B if B contains less than half of A
          1:1 evenly spreads out spirit everywhere
          1:2 will reduce root concentration to below spread
    senses also through spirit
      higher concentration provides higher vision distance
      generally weaker than physical body though, except for energy sensitivity
      spirits can't automatically identify other spirits in the same space, but can potentially
        recognize through energy signatures
    if physical material is bound to a spirit, foreign spirits can't pass through
      neutral matter allows multiple spirits to pass through at once
    spreading out spirit matter also spreads out energy contained by that spirit

  undead

do we need complex surfaces?
  strictly 2d is simpler
  support clouds which combine with character if character moves onto space, then cloud is gone
  can spaces generate clouds? No, better to have a cloud generator
  even items can work this way
  each space can only hold one type of item (although there can be a multiplier with it)
  moving onto an item space can either swap spaces with the item or merge with it
    swap by default, pickup is a special command
  but having water, fire, lava on the floor is meaningful
    can't have swimming, oil, lava, ice otherwise
    so each cell can hold a single object / character type, and has a single surface type
    surface type can be seen as background color of cell
  swimming requires more than just a surface mechanic
    do we support ground mechanic and surface mechanic?
      greatly complicates
      hard to know what is covered up
      can make it exclusive: either a shallow surface over stone, or a deep surface
  best to have under, surface, and over slots

  surfaces
    shallow water - light blue
    deep water - dark blue
    ice - cyan
    stone - dark grey
    dirt - brown
    poison - green
    lava - red
    fire - orange
    oil - black

  still too complicated
  go to only under and over, no surface:

  under
    hot rock - orange ,
    rock - black ,
    cold rock - dark blue ,
    dirt - brown .
    grass - green . 
    burning grass - red .
    forest - green !
    burning forest - red !
    shallow water - light blue ~
    deep water - dark blue ~
    lava - red ~
    tar pit - black ~
    elevated rock - yellow ^

matter
  level 1 matter can only move through unoccupied level 0 space
  level 2 matter can only move through unoccupied level 1 space
  level 1 matter creates level 1 space
  spirit matter must have physical matter to pass through, lower densities means slower movement
    1 point of spacial mass holds 1 points of physical 
    1 point of physical mass can hold 1 points of astral mass
    1 point of astral mass can support 1 points of spirit mass
    1 point of spirit mass can support 1 points of etheric mass
    each level cell typically has 1000 spacial mass
      maybe this can be altered by various circumstances?
  mass of below vs above?
    does spirit pass through ground?
    [ ] support multiple levels (z dimension)
    [ ] flat only
    [*] above and below only, but travel only through above
  physical matter must have spacial matter to pass through
  each type of matter is grouped into pairs
  levels 
    0 spacial matter
    1 physical matter
    2 astral matter
    3 spirit matter
    4 etheric matter
  no just allow matter to pass through independent of other levels of matter
    spirit matter can exist independently of physical
    but doesn't spirit matter need to move with physical?
    spirit matter can be inside or outside
    outside matter steadily dissipates
    inside moves with body

new energy pools
  can't convert from one spectral energy color to another, but can convert between different brightness levels
  black <-  navy      <-> blue        <-> azure       -> white
  black <-  crimson   <-> red         <-> pink        -> white
  black <-  brown     <-> yellow      <-> blonde      -> white
  black <-> dark gray <-> medium gray <-> light gray <-> white

  many basic functions can be performed with pure lumina, but specialized magic requires spectra

  multiple spectra can be combined to form etherea
  etherea has 3 brightness levels like spectra, but can't convert to lumina
  (red orange) <-> copper
  (orange yellow green) <-> silver
  (yellow green cyan blue) <-> gold
  (cyan blue indigo violet red) <-> diamond
  (all spectra) <-> rainbow

  exotica doesn't have multiple brightness levels

throwing
  items can be thrown, but they don't go to the ground, but instead remain where they were with a cooldown before they can be used again
    they can be moved to a different place while in cooldown
  same applies to weapons with projectiles
    projectiles don't have a seperate item each, but instead have a quiver or bag of those projectiles
    once projectiles are fired, they go to a cooldown before they can be fired again
  some weapons are also projectiles themselves, in which case they become inactive until their cooldown completes when thrown
    spear / trident
    boulder
    javelins are quivered
    tomahawks are quivered
  some throwables are special and don't disappear when thrown, but end up on ground
    other characters may be thrown
    scenery items can be thrown (boulders, altars, statues)
    trees become logs when uprooted. Logs are like boulders that remain
  heavier items can displace lighter items
  actors can be pushed into lava pools if a heavier item is thrown

if a flying creature is hit physically, and it's flight comes from a physical mechanism, that flight may be temporarily disabled
  same with a magic attack for flight that is maintained magically

pushing / charging
  a heavier creature can push a lighter creature around, possibly into water or lava pools, or into pits or traps
    but lighter creature has a chance to dodge also, which could result in heavier creature falling down instead

passing
  a creature can pass another non-hostile creature by swapping places with it

inventory
  no actual inventory without a bag, only equippable slots
    high degress of flexibility
      can hold any kind of item in each hand, although can't use a weapon then
      some equipment carries other equip (belts can carry potions or swords)

    hip bag: 3 small items (scales with player size)
      reduces maneuverability and speed
    small backpack: has 6 item spaces (should scale with size of player, 2 for tiny, 4 for small, 6 for medium, 9 for large, 12 for huge)
      reduces maneuverability and speed
    large backpack: has 20 item spaces (10 for tiny, 15 for small, 20 for medium, 30 for large, 40 for huge)
      reduces maneuverability and speed
    space ring: takes a ring slot, can hold a random number of items (1-256, weighted to lower numbers, powers of 2)
      all items take one spot regardless of size
      taking items out or putting them in will consume mp based on size of ring, independent of size of item
        for a 8 item ring, it will require 8 mp to add or remove an item. 
      50% chance: 1
      25% chance: 2
      12% chance: 4
      6% chance: 8
      3% chance: 16
      1.5% chance: 32
      0.7% chance: 64
      0.3% chance: 128
      0.3% chance: 256
    space bracelet: same as space ring, except space starts at 4 instead of 1
    cart: can carry unlimited items of space
      when attached, it makes player 1/2 speed, and costs sp, but will follow player around
      the more items the cart holds, the more strength it requires to move
      sp cost = items / strength
    belt carries potions 4-12 or scrolls (any small items, includes wands)
      can also carry up to two swords
    pants usually have 2 small item spaces available
    cloaks can have 4-8 small OR medium item spaces
  no stash
  no items on floor
    items are made available just after leaving a floor
      player chooses which to pick up / equip, and what to leave behind, which perishes forever
      each floor exit reveals it's own set of items
      always one experience potion if one hasn't already been picked up from this floor
    what about treasure rooms?
      treasure chest is a special fixed location item that allows the player to pick up items
        one time use
  carrying food?
    very limited, often must be eaten on the spot
    food deteriorates (different rates for different foods)
      fresh (1 time unit): full benefit
      stale (2 time units): half benefit
      rotten (4 time units): poisonous, quarter benefit

food
  linear gradation:
    0%   food = 100% form repair,   0% energy production
    100% food =   0% form repair, 100% energy production

baseline decay
  different for different species
  human: 
    1% of max energy drain
    1% of max form drain

age:
  affects different species differently
  usually advances slowly
    but spells or curses can accelerate
    advances with experience
      humans:   5 exp levels = 1 age advancement
      elves:   10 exp levels = 1 age advancement
      orcs:     3 exp levels = 1 age advancement
      dwarves:  7 exp levels = 1 age advancement
      mummy:    immortal, but doesn't auto-repair form decay
  very difficult to stop or reverse
  levels
    junior (0-9 levels)
      20-80% of attribute capacity
      smaller max
      faster energy regen and form regen
    middle (0-9 levels)
      100% base attributes
    senior (0-9 levels)
      80-20% physical attributes
      80-20% mental attributes
      120-180% spirit attributes
    immortal (no levels)
      normally a character will die of old age at this point, but special circumstances can enable immortality
      120% phys, mental, and spirit attributes
      energy and form regen equal to junior
    age examples: j5 m2 m9 s0 s2 i
  potions can temporarily adjust

different way to break down prime health stats:
  ep: physical energy (regen quick) (stamina)
  hp: physical health (regen slow)
  em: mental energy (regen medium) (mana)
  hm: mental health (regen medium)
  es: spirit energy (regen slow) (willpower)
  hs: spirit health (regen quick)

guardians
  prodigy <- 50% aging resistance

    unified hp, sp, mp. Regen is average of the 3
  fortified <- rapid age regression (twice normal speed in reverse)
    all defenses are 50% stronger
  chaos <- remove max damage cap
    good and bad things randomly happen to the player
    good will outweigh the bad in the long term, but player must survive to get there
      3x chance of good vs bad
    50% chance to be saved from a fatal blow
    chance of being removed from a dangerous area if health is low
    can give an item, but may be cursed
    can make monsters appear if situation is too easy for too long
    can buff monsters that are too easy
    can debuff monsters that are tough
  hp after killing monster <- 
  <- harder monsters

pets
  loyalty increases when favors are given
    and tested against challenge / hunger
  can be given commands

start with
  food
  survival guardian
  dog
  teleport scroll
  rusty dagger
  small belt (4 slots for small items)
  hip bag (can fit a medium item or 3 small)

no story or randomized evolving story

first floor doesn't contain items or exp potion
  must survive to the second floor for that
  not needed, getting items only applies to floor transitions anyway

moving to a new floor restores energy, but doesn't heal
  maybe not, fleeing to another floor when exhausted is risky and should be

exp potion different than time advancing potion
  one of each per floor?
  no, regen happens while eating
    but then you get full?
  eat in addition to time potions
    although time potions make you more hungry

level up potions
  one per floor
  level up
  fills energy and health

time potions
  one per floor
  applies regeneration
  makes you more hungry
  advances age

eating
  species have different nutrition values from different food types
  makes you less hungry
  applies regeneration

potions can be applied to weapons or arrows

special scrolls
  reverse scroll
    level up potion becomes level down
    time potion becomes reverse time potion
    poison becomes regen
    exp becomes lose exp
  amp scroll

    max charges: 9

does gold take a slot?
  no, special spot for it
  nothing stacks

base rune language
  needs to combine power of programming with simplicity of a magic mythology
  start with a simple temperature run on a space to increase temp of that space
    how is it created
    how is it altered
    how is it protected
    how can it be conditionally triggered
  different resistance for ally vs enemy
    depending on if item has spirit or not in it, that spirit may resist change
  some properties have a heirarchy of stages, where going up is twice as difficult as going down
  within a stage each form has a different order cost
  all operations need to have balance
    temporary are much cheaper because they balance future with present of same entity
    permanent must balance two different present entities
  each change has activation energy and sustain energy
  subject properties
    existence: no <- yes
    size: 0 <- 12
      0             1kg
      1             2kg

foundation scroll
  only original foundation will have one (can rarely find one)
  will create a new foundation that the player can start with
  can choose one thing to save:
    species
    hard mutations
    guardians
    profession
    discipline (book is kept)
    one skill
    one item
    gold
    age
  inverse of this?
    choose a foundation to load into present character (doesn't reset exp or anything else)
  amp of this?
    choose two things to save

can backtrack one floor, but not two
  items and fixtures remain
  upstairs won't exist for second floor up
  not sure about this

qualities of items
  fragile: 1-2 units of durabilty (0%, only special items have this)
  poor: 10 units of durabilty (10 uses before expired) (10%)
  fair: 100 (40%)
  good: 1000 (40%)
  high: 10,000 (8%)
  superior: 100,000 (1.9%)
  extraordinary: 1,000,000 (0.1%)
  a forge can improve the quality of an item, but not the durability, thus a poor durability 6/10 item becomes 
    a fair durability 60/100, prolonging it's life, but in proportion to where it was
  even gems have a quality
  acid slimes will more rapidly reduce durability 10x
  enchantment reduces durability of items
    you can layer as many enchantments onto an item as you want, but each will reduce base durability one level
    so a good quality sword enchanted with 2 bonuses becomes a poor quality sword, which can only be used a max of 10 times

gems
  quality / durability
  size: 
    tiny: stores 100 energy
    small: 1000
    medium: 10,000
    large: 100,000
    huge: 1,000,000
  type: 
    diamond
    ruby
    emerald
    topaz
    sapphire
    opal
    obsidian

no identification
  not fun enough to be worth it
  rarely will a potion or fountain or scroll be unknown
    1/4 chance of an unidentified item being cursed

no selling
  but you can barter an item when buying
    adding an item to the exchange when buying will reduce the price, but won't ever give extra money back

hazards
  acid rain
    a fixed area that drains durability of exposed items
  lava pool
    high temperature transfer with high heat capacity
  blizzard

building up foundation runes
  one floor simple empty room
    root game rune
      create concept of floors
      each floor has a grid of spaces

study (discipline)
  whatever books are being carried automatically are studied
  exp gains also boost skills in books being studied
  books can have attribute requirements

example rune space
  player.1.location.n.ne.occupant
    player.1.location = zzz
    zzz.n = zzy
    zzy.ne = zzx
    zzx.occupant = zzw
  key/object/player.1/prop/inventory
  value/sword
  value/key
  value/shield
  key/...
  zzz.class = ...
    classes list relators which go with that object
    .parents
    .props required props
      can specify default
  prop.relator = ...
    points to relator which connects one or more props
    .one list of props which can only point to one object
    .many list of props which may point to zero or more objects
  need to record
    resistance to all change
      exists by default, can't be changed
    resistance to enemy change
      can be added with a key
    observation resistance
      10 steps easier than changing
    key to unlock
      complexity of key can make it harder to unlock

store runespace snapshots, separated by diff lists
  but if we store full game logic in the runespace, then this is too much info to be snapshotted, will need to use hashed trees instead
  we could pull core game logic out of runespace, since we don't really want to change that anyway?
    core game logic still different than game state, so snapshots are possible still? snapshots may be faster
  putting game logic into save state also has the benefit of preserving a version of the game within the save game itself, making them more resilient

rune refs, rune ops
  some runes combine properties on top of stack
  unary ops immediately take top of stack and modify
  binary ops take two items on top of stack and combine
  higher intelligence allows for more runes in a structure
  trigger runes are starting points, and have a direction?
  redirection runes can change flow direction, or even split the flow
